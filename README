musl libc testsuite for OS projects
======================================

This is a lot like sortie's OS tester but for general libc things.

This version of the musl testsuite is fitted more closely to OSdevers and supports other libcs rather than just musl's

I. HOW TO USE
======================

First, configure your OS GCC in make.config, then select your OS features in features.config

Running make all will produce "compile_log.txt" - this is a set of all the tests that managed to compile and all the tests that failed to compile.
Just because a test compiled does not mean that it worked. You must run the test program to see if it will work.

II. RUNNING THE TEST PROGRAM
===============================

The test program is built in obj/test_program. You must copy it AND all the tests (from obj/functional, obj/math, and obj/regresssion) into a tests folder
on your OS drive.

Once back in your OS, execute the program as "./test_program <test directory>"
